# Accessible
> A set of functionalities that should be native to the browser

The goal of Accessible is to provide commands that I think should be
native to the browser: *We want better keyboard features.*

## Development

Run `yarn dev` to run the extension in debug mode in Firefox.

## Questions?
- what is the most accessible font?
- what is the most accessible color?
